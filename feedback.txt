The idea is interesting. Some of the user stories can be focused on more. Perhaps focus more on unique functionality. Since this is a generic service, searching for media could be customizable. According to some labels (admin or user added), for example. Focus on functionality that you feel is missing from existing services, and that you would want to try out. 
The explanation mentions discoverability. This is great. In this context, separating the algorithm from the tags could allow better generic discoverability, regardless of media. So you open up the options of discoverability by different (maybe even user-generated) tags, or applying different algorithms to suit different media preferences.
I like the discussion of load balancing and going for the least loaded server. Make sure that your development and submission gives some kind of way to show that that is happening. 
Choosing to go for GoodDNS instead of gateway is fine, but the submission (the reflections document in particular) should reflect that, why you chose this, and how it differs from the standard option. 
Overall, the submission seems to have a clar idea of what is to be accomplished, and offers a good starting point for the project.
